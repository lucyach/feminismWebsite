      <h4 id="list-item-1">Money and Women</h4>
      <p>Money and women should not be complicated. Women should be treated financially as human beings. Historically, they have not been. In America, women could not open a bank account until 1974. Now, women are still oppressed financially. The <strong>Pink Tax</strong> refers to the abnormally large prices of female-marketed products. This includes women's products such as tampons and women-marketed products, such as pink versus blue products. Regarding period products, although tampons are a hygenic necessity, the average woman on an average period with average-priced tampons spends $1,773.33 on tampons alone in her lifetime. The <strong>Wage Gap</strong> is a historical pattern of women being paid less than men. A woman, in the same position with the same responsibilities as a man, will get paid 33% less than the man. This is largely contributed to by societal norms of a woman's place. Women are expected to be housewives and stay at home. They are also stereotyped as not as able to do work as well as men. Therefore, men believe women deserve less money than other men.</p>

      <h4 id="list-item-2">Feelings and Women</h4>
      <p>A major issue women face is the disregard of their feelings. Whether this is sexual, emotional, romantic, or professional, women's feelings are widely and wildly neglected. This is because men see women as objects. That is a commonly used phrase, and most men do percieve women with feelings, they just do not care about them and instead cater to their own egos. However, a study has shown that some extremely sexist men can sometimes see women as literal objects. "Sey women in bikinis really do inspire men to see them as objects, according to a new study of male behavior. Brain scans revealed that when men are shown pictures of scantily clas women, <strong>the region of the brain associated with tool use lights up</strong>. Men were also more likely to associate images of sexualized women with first-person verbs such as "I push, I grasp, I handle," said lead researcher Susan Fiske,  psychologist at Princeton University. And in a "shocking" find, Fiske noted, some of the men studied <strong>showed no activity</strong> in the aprt of their brain that usually responds when a person ponders another's intentions. This means that these <strong>men see women "as sexually inviting, but they are not thinking about their minds,"</strong> Fiske said. "The lack of activation in this social cognition area is really odd, because it hardly ever happens." Fiske and colleagues asked 21 heterosexual male volunteers to first take a test that scores people based on different types of sexist attitudes. The subjects were then shown pictures of both skimpily dressed and fully clothed men and women. Most of the men best remembered <strong>headless</strong> photographs of women in bikinis, even if they'd only seen the image for two-tenths of a second, Fiske reported this weekend in Chicago during the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. And the men who scored higher as "hostile sexists"-those who view women as controlling and invaders of male space-<strong>didn't show brain activity that indicates they saw the women in bikinis as humans with thoughts and intentions.</strong> Scientists have seen this absence of activation only once before, in a study where people were shown off-putting photographs of homeless and drug addicts." When men do acknowledge women's feelings, it is unfairly. In a study about anger in men versus women, "participants also answered questions about the source of the anger (i.e., to what they attributed the anger). <strong>For angry men, the anger was more often attributed to external sources</strong> (e.g., the situation they were in, the people they were dealing with). <strong>For angry women, though, the anger was attributed to their personality.</strong> What's important to note here is that in these videos, only the gender of the target was changed; not the situation. In the exact same situation and when expressing emotion in the exact same way, men were percieved as victims of frustrating circumstances while women were percieved as out of control."</p>
